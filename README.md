# Unorphanize: Vanilla Edition
#### Prevent orphans with zero dependencies

Need to unorphanize the things without depending on jQuery? Then this little plugin is for you. Based on https://github.com/simeydotme/jQuery-Unorphanize.

## Usage
1. Include vanilla-unorphanize.js in your project
2. Basic instantiation: `new unorphanize( 'p' ); // Prevent orphans in all paragraphs`
2. Custom instantiation: `new unorphanize( 'p', { companions: 2 } ); // Prevent orphans in all paragraphs w/ set number of companions`

Pretty easy, right? Feel free to share, modify, and use this plugin in all your projects. I only ask that you let me know what you build! Thanks.
